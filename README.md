# Movies Recommendation System

A FastAPI-based movie recommendation system under active development. The goal of this application is to provide movie recommendations using various algorithms including popularity-based, collaborative filtering, and content-based approaches, each accessible through separate API endpoints.

## Planned Features
- **Popularity-Based Recommendations:** Uses a weighted rating system to rank movies.
- **Content-Based Recommendations:** Provides movie suggestions based on movie metadata such as genres, cast, and crew.
- **Collaborative Recommendations:** Recommends movies based on user interactions and preferences.

### Endpoints
1. :white_check_mark: `/popularity` - Provides popularity-based movie recommendations.
2. :white_check_mark: `/content` - Content-based movie recommendations.
3.  `/collaborative` - Collaborative-based recommendations.


## Current Status
- The popularity-based and the content-based recommendation system are currently being developed.
- The other endpoint (`/collaborative`) is under development.
